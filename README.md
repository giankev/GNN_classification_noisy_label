## Description of the solution

### Image teaser explaining the procedure
The procedure used consist in a search of the better hyperparameters and modification of the nodes. Also was created a Transformer node to use into GNN.

### Overview of the method
For the hackaton was used different hyperparamenters for the four datasets: A, B, C and D.
After an accurate analysis the best hyperparameters found are:

#### A:
-
-
-

#### B:
-
-
-

#### C:
-
-
-

#### D:
-
-
-
